## Technologies

I used..
- ReactJs
- NextJS
- TailwindCss
- Tmdb api


## Approach

- I was fasinated by the NextJs's server side rendering and caching methods. So, I tried making this app rendered on the server side which helps to load the website faster on the browser.
- Created separate files for the fetch api since its being used to fetch data for different pages.
    - some fetch routes only required subtle pathname changes.
    - created 3 files for overall movies list, a particular movie data, video data.
- Learnt to use Tailwind Css which really boosts the development experience
- My main goal with project was to get a good grip on fetching api data and to render them on to the page.
- The challenging part was to not use client side rendering on main pages which was new to me.
- I used an online template to create the animation for the loading page.
